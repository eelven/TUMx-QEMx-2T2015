1-0 LECTURE: Defining Quality

The involvement of the customer is not obvious, especially not
in complex environments. One of the most difficult parts of a quality
improvement program is to define the problem and to bring all 
the stakeholders together to define the exact project that will be undertaken.
This is why the "define" part of the DMAIC process is so important.

We have left out one important aspect of quality, though,
and that is we need to consider the value
of the quality to the customer. As Godfrey says,
"The most fundamental truth is, that quality is relative:
the customer simply focuses on value
seen as quality over price."
We can only succeed if we're able to
offer more value than our competitors.
And quality can have many different dimensions. For example,
product performance, the reliability of the product,
the durability of the product, service ability. Quality must be defined
according to what the customer wants
and this must be in terms of measurable characteristics,
within the limits of their variability.
