1-0 LECTURE: Intro - DEFINE

The involvement of the customer is not obvious, especially not
in complex environments. One of the most difficult parts of a quality
improvement program is to define the problem and to bring all 
the stakeholders together to define the exact project that will be undertaken.
This is why the "define" part of the DMAIC process is so important.
We have left out one important aspect of quality, though,
and that is we need to consider the value
of the quality to the customer. As Godfrey says,
"The most fundamental truth is, that quality is relative:
the customer simply focuses on value
seen as quality over price."
We can only succeed if we're able to
offer more value than our competitors.
And quality can have many different dimensions. For example,
product performance, the reliability of the product,
the durability of the product, service ability. Quality must be defined
according to what the customer wants
and this must be in terms of measurable characteristics,
within the limits of their variability.

1-1 LECTURE: Defining Quality

Quality:
"fitness for use and meeting or exceeding the customer expectations."
And then we have a
more recent definition by Professor Godfrey from North Carolina State
University,
and he says the most fundamental truth is that quality
is relative. The customer focuses on value
and it sees this value as a ratio
of quality to price, and
only when we offer more value than our competitors
do we truly succeed. So we also mentioned quality means 
different things to different people.
Quality could be for you the fact that the product works, the performance
of the product.
It could be the reliability of the product,
it could be the features that the product had or,
maybe, the aesthetics of the product.
It could be also a perceived quality--how do you
perceive the quality as your product, or today we're talking a lot about
sustainability aspects of the product. Quality must be
defined for each product based on what the customer
wants in the product through--
and this is important for our for our course--
it must be defined through measurable characteristics
and their limits of variability. So
quality is always relative to a set of requirements, to a set of specifications.
These can be functional requirements, these could be
subjective requirements, and quality means
meeting or exceeding customer expectations
depending on what the customer sees as quality.
So we understand that now.
What is non-quality? What do I mean by non-quality?
Quote from Warren Buffett:
"It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it.
If you think about that, then you'll do things differently."
And I think this tells us what
we all know non-quality means. If you think
of some of the product recalls that have happened recently,
if you think of the fines that the big companies
who've had big recalls have to pay or the damage to their reputation or to their sales.
The past view of quality management
was that this is very much end-of-line testing.
The products would come out of the line and be tested, and either they would be scrapped
or they would be reworked. Quality was viewed as costly and very very reactive,
something that would add time and resources,
consumption to your process, but today that has changed. And what we'd like to do now
is to review
the main milestones in quality management
over the past 100 years or so.
So here we see then from our textbook (4:25)
some of the major milestones, and we'd just like to highlight
the most important ones. And of course we start with the 1920s with Dr. Shewhart
from Bell Labs.
And Dr. Shewhart developed the fundamentals of the statistical methods
that are used today
for statistical process control and control charts.
And Drs. Dodge and Roming worked on statistical sampling plans, also a
key for quality management, and
we also had then the contributions of designed experiments.
So Sir Ronald Fisher,
he was working on agricultural yields,
and of course we have Dr. Taguchi, who was looking at
process and product D.O.E.s for engineers.
Now, in World War II the US military started using
statistical methods in order to produce goods
and ammunition, and after the war
there was many developments in the
science of reliability. But it wasn't until
after the war that the more exciting quality management
concepts were developed, then, for consumers,
for consumer production. And of course we start with
Edward Deming who went to Japan,
bringing Dr. Shewhart's ideas of statistical process control
to the Japanese automobile industry, and here we have the birth
of, with the Japanese, the worth of Toyota Production System,
also known as lean manufacturing. And this meant
that the Japanese automobile industry suddenly presented a huge
competition to the American
automobile industry. And it was understood
the power of these quality methods, and
in the 1980s, Motorola made a huge step
with their Six Sigma process,
a data-driven, systematic,
problem-solving approach following also the DMAIC flow.
In 1987, we saw the standardization
of quality standards
as part of the International Organization for Standardization.
This was the ISO 9000 standards at the time.
And today we see the acceptance of quality
as a critical strategic parameter
in business planning. And the customers--we are also interested in quality.
Particularly as we're looking at a more global
market and production, we're interested in quality,
and even more so now we're starting to look at sustainability.
So just to give you an example of Six Sigma.
So here is a picture of
the Mini. Now this is not a real example for the Mini but suppose you have an
automobile
with 10,000 parts
and processes. So
if you have in those 10,000 parts and processes a failure rate of 6,210
parts-per-million. So for every million
part every million parts you have one failure
and you have 10,000 parts or processes. Then you can expect to have none
of your automobiles fault-free. If you
have a Six Sigma quality, if you have controlled your process to
3.4 defects per million
then you will have roughly 97 percent of
your product defect-free. So
this is showing us then
that if you have complex processes, if you have complex products,
if you use statistics in quality,
you can push your production from being
from having 0 good parts
to having nearly defect-free parts. Now
we wanted to talk again a little bit also about today's view of quality
management, and this is from
a presentation by Dr. Manfred Seiker here in Munich.
He's worked many years in quality management, and I like the way
he presents this. He looks at quality management
as a set of enablers and a set of results.
And across the bottom you see people, processes,
products, and then people again. And
at two different levels, you see subjective and objective. So
what this means--let's start in the top corner. In order to have
quality management in your organization, you need to have the leadership,
the employees, the value and the culture,
dedicated to quality. These subjective
ideas that then can be used to enforce
the objectives, strategy, management,
and targets for a quality organization, quality in the organization.
Now then, in order to
realize these targets, you have to manage change.
You have to manage change to change your processes, both your
internal and your external processes, and processes to do with your suppliers,
to develop quality processes.
Those are all the enablers. Then we move to the results.
Having quality processes, having the quality mindsets,
brings, then, quality products. And again, quality products
depends on what the customer expectations are.
You are meeting or exceeding customer expectations.
And then finally, who does this affect?
What are the results? You have your customers,
you have the society that is receiving your products,
but also as Dr. Seiker points out,
we have the stakeholders in the company, a very critical
part of our entire quality
management. These are the people interested in the success of the company.
Now what does it take to realize this?
Of course, we are looking at statistics in this course. We're going to be looking at
the processes and products, we're going to be evaluating
their performance and looking at ways to improve that, but
what else does this involve? And here,
in this next slide, Dr. Seiker has added
all the different people that are involved.
And you can see here finance, you can see here management.
You have the quality engineers doing the statistics.
You have the marketing. You have the product developers.
You have the communication. You have customers. Everybody in the company
is involved in the quality management. It is just not--
it's no longer just the inspection team at the end of the line
doing a sorting of the final products. It is a mindset,
it is a philosophy, which then drives the company
towards a goal of total quality management.
